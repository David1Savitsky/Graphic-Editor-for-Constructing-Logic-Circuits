# Graphic-Editor-for-Constructing-Logic-Circuits

_This application consists of 5 modules. The rules for using this application are absolutely simple. If you need to design a combinatorial scheme, but it is extremely lazy to build element by element, and there is not enough time, the graphic editor contains a unique opportunity to build it right away. All you need to do is enter a boolean expression in the field (which is at the bottom), and then press the "Construct" button (or the ENTER key). If you want to design the circuit yourself, then all you need to do is use the 8 buttons located on the left side of the application. To position an element, select the element of interest with one click, and then place it in a convenient place with a double click. If you accidentally selected the wrong element, right-click on the logical element that you want to delete. Of course, you need to show the result of your work, so by choosing File-> Import on the panel, your scheme will be saved on the device as a BMP image. Have a good time in the cool and convenient graphic editor "Logical calculator" :-)_
